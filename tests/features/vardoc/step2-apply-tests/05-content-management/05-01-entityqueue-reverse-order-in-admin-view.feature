Feature: Content Management - Standard Entity Queue Management - Have the option to Reverse order in admin view
As a logged in user with a permission to manage entity queues
I well be able to view the order of entities in entity queues in a reverse order.
So that they will have a flipped order at the front-end.

@javascript @local @development
Scenario: Check that Reverse order in admin view is working
  Given I am a logged in user with the "webmaster" user
   When I go to "/admin/structure/entityqueue"
    And I wait
   Then I should see "Test Queue"
   When I click "Edit items" in the "Test Queue" row
    And I wait
   Then I should see "Edit subqueue Test Queue"
    And I should see "Test content N1" in the "#edit-items-0-target-id" element
    And I should see "Test content N2" in the "#edit-items-1-target-id" element
    And I should see "Test content N3" in the "#edit-items-2-target-id" element

   When I go to "/admin/structure/entityqueue/test_queue#edit-queue-settings"
    And I wait
   Then I should see "Edit Entity Queue"
   When I click "Queue settings"
    And I wait
   Then I should see "Restrict this queue to a minimum of"
    And I should see "Reverse order in admin view"
   When I check the box "Reverse order in admin view"
    And I press "Save"
    And I wait
   Then I should see "The entity queue Test Queue has been updated."
   When I go to "/admin/structure/entityqueue"
    And I wait
   Then I should see "Test Queue"
   When I click "Edit items" in the "Test Queue" row
    And I wait
