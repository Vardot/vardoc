## About Vardoc
Vardoc is a knowledge base system, a wiki system, and a documentation management
 system designed to host massive amount of content in a structured and
 easy-to-find format. Vardoc helps you build a connected organization,

 processes. With easy structure, collaborative tools, and friendly design.
