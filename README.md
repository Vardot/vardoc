# Vardoc: Knowledge Base System and Documentation Site

Vardoc is a knowledge base system, a wiki system, and a documentation management
system designed to host massive amount of content in a structured and 
easy-to-find format. Vardoc helps you build a connected organization, product,
 or knowledge area to allow everyone involved to find the answers they seek,
 and contribute their expertise in the knowledge base.

Think of it as a wiki site of your product, user manuals, or organizational
 processes. With easy structure, collaborative tools, and friendly design.

Built on top of Varbase, the open source Drupal 8 distribution, Vardoc provides
 powerful functional features such as editorial features, search function,
 taxonomy, user management, and customizable themes. It also delivers top-notch
 non-functional requirements such as enterprise security, fast performance,
 search engine optimization (SEO), accessibility compliance, and many more
 features.
